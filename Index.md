This site is meant for me to be able to document my ever-changing model for building, operating, and maintaining services.  There are many models that already exist each focusing on a different area, but in the interest of brevity I'm taking the learnings from each and documenting.

I don't feel that this is ever complete or a drop-in solution, but rather a starting point if asked _how should we do X_.

I've often heard "we're a new team" as an excuse for missing core (or what I feel are core) rhythm of business functions.  I feel that this is not a valid excuse when we have experienced individuals.  We've been there, done that, so we shall bring our learnings are a starting point that the team can customize as fit.
